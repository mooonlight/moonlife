Easily the most comfortable overear headphones I've worn with glasses. The sound quality is great, as well.

9Grado's are ugly and on year, not over ear but the sound quality is :100:

I've found these to be very light and comfortable to wear with glasses for extended periods of time. Non-ostentatious design and sounds great. Both @jcarbaugh and I have these for the past couple of years and they've held up really well. You can snag them for under 100 when they are discounted.

*Single caveat — The cable's proprietary design (due to the 2.5mm and 3.5mm ends) means you can't easily swap it out with another. I had to replace mine once when I accidently yanked the cord from the headphones. Also keep away from cats. Mine enjoys chewing on the cable.*
